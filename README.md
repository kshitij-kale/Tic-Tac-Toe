# Tic-Tac-Toe
Play tic tac toe online with an AI on a custom size grid with varying difficulty levels.

## Plan
1. Make the html, css and javascript file
2. Make the UI without the grid
3. Add functionality to the UI
4. Make the startGame function
5. Dynamically draw the grid
6. Randomly choose a player
7. add eventlisteners to play
8. add the x's and o's alternatively
9. make the checkState function and optimize it and also create a hashmap for optimization
10. add the winning logic and complete start button functionality(pre game, mid game, post game)
11. add winning animation
11. Write the minimax algorithm and do alpha beta pruning
12. complete rest of code and debug
